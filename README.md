types, the top ten for each dataset, and basic statistics for numeric columns
(Count, mean, std, min, max). Add your comments about the data
> Show the missing data and incorrect values for each column, such as zeros or
negative sales.
> Decide how you want to handle missing and incorrect values and implement it.
